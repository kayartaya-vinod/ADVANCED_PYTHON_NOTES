There are different methods to install Django on your computer.

The best method for most users is to install an official release. Run the following command from your terminal (command prompt on Windows).

```unix
$ pip install Django
```

Or if pip is not available at the propmpt, 

```unix
$ python -m pip install Django
```

Verifying:


To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type `python` from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django:

```python
>>> import django
>>> django.get_version()
'2.1'
>>> 
```

You may have another version of Django installed.
